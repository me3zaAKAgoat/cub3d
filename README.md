## Overview

cub3D is a graphics programming project that draws inspiration from the iconic game Wolfenstein 3D. It aims to replicate the immersive 3D environment of a maze from a first-person perspective using Ray Casting techniques. By delving into Ray Casting, developers gain insights into the intersection of mathematics and graphics, honing skills in window management, color manipulation, event handling, and algorithmic design.

### Understanding Ray Casting

Ray Casting is a fundamental rendering technique used to simulate a 3D perspective in a 2D map. It involves casting rays from the viewer's perspective and determining what objects or walls they intersect with. This method, although simplistic compared to modern rendering techniques, was revolutionary in its time and played a crucial role in early 3D game development.

### History of Ray Casting

Ray Casting has its roots in computer graphics research dating back to the 1960s. In 1968, Ivan Sutherland developed the first interactive computer graphics program called "Sketchpad," which used a form of ray tracing. However, it was not until the early 1980s that Ray Casting gained prominence in the context of computer gaming.

In 1981, the game "Castle Wolfenstein" introduced the concept of first-person perspective and stealth-based gameplay. This laid the groundwork for future developments in the genre. In 1992, id Software released "Wolfenstein 3D," which popularized Ray Casting as a technique for rendering pseudo-3D environments in real-time.

### Wolfenstein 3D Influence

"Wolfenstein 3D" revolutionized the gaming industry by demonstrating the potential of Ray Casting for creating immersive 3D environments. Players navigated through maze-like levels, battling enemies and discovering secrets, all within a compelling first-person perspective. The game's success and innovation paved the way for future titles, including the iconic "Doom" series.

### Skills Showcased

The development of cub3D requires proficiency in several key areas:

- **Mathematics**: A solid understanding of trigonometry and linear algebra is necessary for manipulating vectors and angles to create the 3D environment.

- **C Programming**: Strong skills in C programming are essential for implementing algorithms, managing memory, and ensuring efficient code execution.

- **miniLibX Library**: Familiarity with the miniLibX library is crucial for handling graphical operations, window management, and rendering textures with precision.

## Features

- **Ray-Casting:** Implements dynamic views inside a maze using Ray Casting principles.
- **Graphics:** Utilizes the miniLibX library for efficient window management.
- **Textures:** Displays different wall textures based on the wall's facing direction (North, South, East, West).
- **Colors:** Customizes floor and ceiling colors for visual enhancement.
- **Controls:** Supports keyboard controls (W, A, S, D) for navigation and arrow keys for view rotation.
- **Scene Description:** Parses a scene description file with textures, colors, and map layout details.
- **Wall Collisions:** Detects and handles collisions with walls for realistic movement.
- **Minimap System:** Provides a minimap for better spatial awareness.
- **Doors Functionality:** Implements doors that can be opened and closed for added complexity.
- **Mouse-Based POV Rotation:** Enables POV rotation using the mouse for intuitive control.
