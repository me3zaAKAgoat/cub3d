## Overview
cub3D is a graphics programming project inspired by the iconic Wolfenstein 3D game. The goal is to create a realistic 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person perspective using Ray Casting principles. The project explores the practical applications of mathematics and graphic design, enhancing skills in areas like windows, colors, events, and algorithm development.

## Understanding Ray Casting
Ray Casting is a rendering technique used to simulate a 3D perspective in a 2D map. It works by casting rays from the player's viewpoint, determining what objects or walls they intersect with, and rendering the scene accordingly. This method, though simplistic compared to modern rendering techniques, was revolutionary in its time and laid the foundation for many early 3D games.

## Wolfenstein 3D Influence
Wolfenstein 3D, released in 1992 by id Software, is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of the first-person shooter genre. It utilized Ray Casting to create a pseudo-3D environment, allowing players to navigate through maze-like levels while battling enemies. The game's success and innovation cemented Ray Casting as a viable technique for creating immersive 3D experiences.

## Skills Showcased
The development of cub3D requires proficiency in several key areas:

- **Mathematics:** A solid understanding of trigonometry and linear algebra is necessary for manipulating vectors and angles to create the 3D environment.
  
- **C Programming:** Strong skills in C programming are essential for implementing algorithms, managing memory, and ensuring efficient code execution.
  
- **miniLibX Library:** Familiarity with the miniLibX library is crucial for handling graphical operations, window management, and rendering textures with precision.

## Features

- **Ray-Casting:** Implements dynamic views inside a maze using Ray Casting principles.
- **Graphics:** Utilizes the miniLibX library for efficient window management.
- **Textures:** Displays different wall textures based on the wall's facing direction (North, South, East, West).
- **Colors:** Customizes floor and ceiling colors for visual enhancement.
- **Controls:** Supports keyboard controls (W, A, S, D) for navigation and arrow keys for view rotation.
- **Scene Description:** Parses a scene description file with textures, colors, and map layout details.
- **Wall Collisions:** Detects and handles collisions with walls for realistic movement.
- **Minimap System:** Provides a minimap for better spatial awareness.
- **Doors Functionality:** Implements doors that can be opened and closed for added complexity.
